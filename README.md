# C_Exercism

Welcome to **C_Exercism** – a repository containing my solutions to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/c)'s C language track exercises. This project is part of my effort to deepen my understanding of the C programming language through hands-on problem solving.

## 📁 Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own directory with the following typical contents:

- `*.c` – Main solution file(s)
- `*.h` – Header file(s), if applicable
- `test`/`*.test.c` – Test files (as provided or written)
- `Makefile` – For building and running tests

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the tests for a given exercise:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory:
   ```bash
   cd lean
   make test

Most exercises include test cases provided by Exercism. If a Makefile is included, it typically provides a test target for easy compilation and execution.

    💡 Note: You’ll need a C compiler (such as gcc) installed on your system.
